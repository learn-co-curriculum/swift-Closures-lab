# Closures



> Functions can be assigned to variables and passed in and out of other functions as arguments, just as an Int or a String can be.

> Functions can capture variables that exist outside of their local scope.

> There are two ways of creating functions — either with the func keyword, or with { }. Swift calls the latter closure expressions.”
